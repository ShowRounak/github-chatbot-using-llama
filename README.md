# Chat with GitHub Repo with Llama2
This project is a codebase chatbot that allows users to interact with their codebase using the Llama2 Large Language Model (LLM). It utilizes a Streamlit app to provide a user-friendly chat interface.

This project uses the Llama2-7b-chat model. And to use that model, you have to first request access to Llama 2 models via Meta website and also accept to share your account details with Meta on the Hugging Face website. It typically takes a few minutes or hours to get the access.

You can install all the dependencies to run this file by running this command:
` pip install -r requirements.txt `

Llama2 is a heavy model. If your local system does not support this, then you can try the *practice.ipynb* file on Google Colab.
